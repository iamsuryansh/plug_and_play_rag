🚀 Just shipped a production-ready RAG system that transforms how we interact with databases!

Key achievements:
✅ 2000+ lines of Python with FastAPI + ChromaDB
✅ Event-driven architecture using Kafka & Redis
✅ Sub-second semantic search across PostgreSQL/MongoDB
✅ Horizontally scalable microservices design

This system lets you ask "What are our best-performing products?" instead of writing complex SQL queries.

The magic happens through:
🔹 Sentence Transformers for embeddings
🔹 ChromaDB for vector similarity search
🔹 Google Gemini AI for intelligent responses
🔹 Kafka for real-time data processing

1/7 🧵 Just built a RAG system that lets you chat with your databases using natural language

Instead of: SELECT * WHERE category = 'tech' AND date > '2024'
You ask: "What tech articles did we publish recently?"

2/7 Architecture deep dive:
• FastAPI for lightning-fast APIs
• ChromaDB for vector similarity search  
• Kafka for event-driven data processing
• Redis for real-time status tracking
• Docker for seamless deployment
